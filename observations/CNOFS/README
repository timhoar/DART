If you are trying to convert radio occultation observations from the COSMIC Data Analysis 
and Archive Center (CDAAC) http://cdaac-www.cosmic.ucar.edu/cdaac/index.html
you should explore the observations/gps converter before trying to coerce your observations
into an ascii file that matches the format expected by CNOFS_text_to_obs.f90. 

The observations/gps converters work with ionPrf and atmPrf. It may be trivial to
extend to other satellite/data products.
